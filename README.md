# SQL-Capstone-Project
The document provided contains a series of SQL queries related to an Airline Database, likely for a capstone project.

1. **Date Formatting**: Reformatting book_date columns to specific date formats and retrieving key booking details.
2. **Passenger and Booking Information**: Retrieving details such as ticket number, seat number, and passenger ID.
3. **Seat Allocation and Payments**: Finding the least allocated seat, highest and lowest paying passengers on a monthly basis.
4. **Flight Information**: Retrieving travel details for nonstop or return journeys, identifying morning flights, and finding flights without actual departures.
5. **Airport and Flight Analysis**: Counting flights from specific airports, finding airports with the most or least departures, and identifying flights.
6. **Flight Delays and Cancellations**: Identifying flights that are delayed or canceled for passengers.
7. **Seat Conditions**: Analyzing the number of seats in different fare classes and determining aircraft with business-class seating.
8. **Miscellaneous Queries**: Including identifying longest flights, earliest morning flights, flight range, and identifying airports in specific time zones.

Each query is structured with SQL syntax, often using `JOIN` operations to combine multiple tables. Many of the queries involve `GROUP BY` and `ROW_NUMBER()` functions for sorting and partitioning data. The project showcases a wide variety of operations in SQL, emphasizing data retrieval, formatting, and aggregation.
